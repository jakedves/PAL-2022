# PAL

Peer-Assisted Learning sessions *(PAL)* are optional sessions for first year Computer Scientists at the University of Bath led by second-years, where students can come to get help and clarifications on some of the topics that can be quite difficult to grasp from lectures alone. We provide help with coursework, content and also provide some useful tips that we used to do well in the year, in a much more informal and interactive way than traditional teaching.
